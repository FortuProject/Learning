This is a multiclass Keras model in juypter. 
It is poor at dealing with bias. 
It was trained on sorted images of various seen samples. 
It worked at around 80-85% accuracy at diagnosis of samples in a patient assuming they had a decent sample size of pictures. 
It's training data is omitted from this notebook; the code will not run.
